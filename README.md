# React Challenge
## Objective
 * Reinforced practice of creating layouts in React using Tailwind.
 * Using Next to create an application with two routed pages.
 * JSX trial by fire.
 * learning how to learn.
 ## Rules 
 1. Create a website that contains TWO PAGEs that successfully implements the layouts shown in the wireframes in the documentation directory. These pages should be fully responsive, and conform to the mobile layout on small devices.
 2. Use whatever content, placeholder images and text you want.
 3. You can copy snippets from example documentation where you need to, BUT no copy/pasting from pre-built template. The challenge here is to create these pages from scratch using Tailwind and Flowbite React.
4. No need for CDN Links or installing other dependencies. This project includes all the dependencies you need to complete this assignment. Reference the Getting Started section for instructions on installing React and other dependencies. 
 **Code taken from the official Tailwind documentation, Flowbite React Documentation, FontAwesome documentation, Bootstrap Challenge and Example Capstone repository is excepted.**
## Getting started
1. Clone down the repo from Github
2. cd in `/frontend` and run `npm install`
3. run `npm run dev` to start the development server
4. go to localhost:3000 in the browser to see the React application
